Story Start: Opening Cutscene with Narration
Step 1: Opening Cutscene with Narration
The game begins with a cinematic that uses camera pans and dynamic visuals (e.g., nighttime cityscapes, eerie alleyways, flickering lights) to set the mood.
Example Narration:

Narrator.Text = {
    "In the heart of a bustling metropolis lies a hidden world of shadows and secrets.",
    "Whispers of urban legends and strange disappearances have gripped the city in fear.",
    "But when the truth hides in the dark, someone must step into the light.",
    "Welcome to the Mystery Seekers—a club dedicated to unraveling the unknown."
}
The cutscene transitions to the player standing outside the Mystery Seekers’ headquarters, a quirky yet mysterious building with a glowing sign.
