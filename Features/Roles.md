# Implementing Role Selection in Roblox

1. **Role Selection Interface**:
   - Create a GUI (Graphical User Interface) where players can choose their roles. This can be a simple screen with buttons representing different roles.
   - Each button can trigger a function that assigns the selected role to the player.

2. **Assigning Roles via Items**:
   - Use specific items or tools to represent different roles. For example, a sword could represent a warrior, a staff for a mage, etc.
   - When a player picks up an item, you can change their role based on the item they are holding.

3. **Role-Specific Abilities and Stats**:
   - Modify player stats and abilities based on their selected role. This can include changing their health, speed, damage output, and available skills.

4. **Role-Specific Gear**:
   - Equip players with role-specific gear and items. You can automatically equip certain items based on the selected role.

### Example Code for Role Selection

#### GUI Setup

1. **Create a ScreenGui**:
   - In Roblox Studio, create a new ScreenGui in the StarterGui service.

2. **Add Buttons for Roles**:
   - Add TextButtons to the ScreenGui for each role.

3. **Script to Assign Roles**:
   - Create a LocalScript in the ScreenGui to handle button clicks and assign roles.

```lua
-- LocalScript inside the ScreenGui

local warriorButton = script.Parent:WaitForChild("WarriorButton")
local mageButton = script.Parent:WaitForChild("MageButton")
local archerButton = script.Parent:WaitForChild("ArcherButton")

local function assignRole(role)
    -- Send the role to the server
    game.ReplicatedStorage.AssignRole:FireServer(role)
end

warriorButton.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
    assignRole("Warrior")
end)

mageButton.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
    assignRole("Mage")
end)

archerButton.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
    assignRole("Archer")
end)
```

### Server-Side Role Assignment
1. Create a RemoteEvent:
  - In ReplicatedStorage, create a RemoteEvent named AssignRole.

2. Script to Handle Role Assignment:
  - Create a Script in ServerScriptService to handle the role assignment.


```lua
-- Script inside ServerScriptService

local assignRoleEvent = game.ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("AssignRole")

local function onAssignRole(player, role)
    -- Set player role in a custom attribute or value
    player:SetAttribute("Role", role)

    -- Adjust player stats and abilities based on role
    if role == "Warrior" then
        player.Character.Humanoid.MaxHealth = 150
        player.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 16
        -- Equip warrior items
    elseif role == "Mage" then
        player.Character.Humanoid.MaxHealth = 100
        player.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 14
        -- Equip mage items
    elseif role == "Archer" then
        player.Character.Humanoid.MaxHealth = 120
        player.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 18
        -- Equip archer items
    end
    player.Character.Humanoid.Health = player.Character.Humanoid.MaxHealth
end

assignRoleEvent.OnServerEvent:Connect(onAssignRole)
```
### Using Items to Assign Roles

Alternatively, you can use items to assign roles directly.

1. Create Role Items:
  - Create tools or items that represent each role.

2. Script to Assign Role on Item Pickup:
   - Add a Script to each tool that assigns the role when the tool is equipped.
  
```lua
-- Script inside each Tool

local tool = script.Parent

tool.Equipped:Connect(function()
    local player = game.Players:GetPlayerFromCharacter(tool.Parent)
    if player then
        local role = tool.Name  -- Assuming the tool's name is the role name
        player:SetAttribute("Role", role)

        -- Adjust player stats and abilities based on role
        if role == "Warrior" then
            player.Character.Humanoid.MaxHealth = 150
            player.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 16
        elseif role == "Mage" then
            player.Character.Humanoid.MaxHealth = 100
            player.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 14
        elseif role == "Archer" then
            player.Character.Humanoid.MaxHealth = 120
            player.Character.Humanoid.WalkSpeed = 18
        end
        player.Character.Humanoid.Health = player.Character.Humanoid.MaxHealth
    end
end)
```
